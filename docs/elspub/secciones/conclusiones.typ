= Conclusions

The increase in the progressivity of the pension system has positive effects on aggregate efficiency only if it is accompanied by an increase in the formality rate.
  
This is because the positive effect of a progressive pension, functioning as a coverage mechanism against random shocks, expands *vis a vis* the negative effect that distorts the labor market.
  
The combination between fiscal sustainability and efficiency increase is dominated by the level of the formality rate rather than the level of the system's progressivity.
