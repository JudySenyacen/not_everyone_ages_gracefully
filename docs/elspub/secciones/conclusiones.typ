= Conclusions

Increasing the progressivity of the pension system has positive effects on aggregate efficiency only if it is accompanied by an increase in the formal employment rate.
  
This is because the positive effect of a progressive pension, functioning as a safety net against unpredictable shocks, is offset by the negative effect that distorts the labor market.
  
The combination of fiscal sustainability and increased efficiency is dominated by the level of the formality rate rather than by the level of progressivity of the system.
